### <summary>
### Constructs a displaced moving average ribbon and buys when all are lined up, liquidates when they all line down
### Ribbons are great for visualizing trends
### Signals are generated when they all line up in a paricular direction
### A buy signal is when the values of the indicators are increasing (from slowest to fastest).
### A sell signal is when the values of the indicators are decreasing (from slowest to fastest).
